# Creating My First Game Without Programming: A Beginner's Journey

I was 12 years old and I knew exactly what I wanted to do: **make a game**. What I didn't know was how to do it, or even what the process looked like. But that didn't stop me.

## Finding the Right Tool

After searching around, I discovered **[Raycasting Game Maker](http://www.flat2d.com/rgm.html)** - the first game engine I found that required no programming. For a 12-year-old newcomer with zero coding experience, this was perfect. It promised to let anyone create corridor shooters without writing a single line of code. For me at that time programming was something that smart dudes with years of experience in math do, not kids. That was a misconception that blocked my progression for some time, but more on that next time.

The concept was straightforward: create a game where the player escapes from prison. Simple premise, endless possibilities.

## DIY Game Development

### The Art "Pipeline"
My artistic workflow was... unconventional:
- **Weapons**: Hand-drawn by me or taken from the web
- **Characters**: Cut out from GTA San Andreas screenshots (don't tell Rockstar!)
- **Textures**: A mix of free resources and my own pixel art attempts

It wasn't pretty, but it was mine or at least modified by me. I definetely rushed assets which has not played nice to the final result.

*The Raycasting Game Maker interface - where the magic happened. Simple grid-based level design made it easy to create complex prison layouts.*

### The Game Concept
The Prisoner - a corridor shooter where you play as a... surprise.. prisoner fighting your way to freedom. Move through prison corridors, shoot guards, find keys, escape. I managed to create 14 levels with different types of gameplay: shooting sections, puzzle areas where you had to find the exit, and intense chase sequences where you had to run from enemies.

## Dopamine hit is real

Despite the crude graphics and simple mechanics, there was something incredibly satisfying about the whole process. Each small addition - a new sound effect, a working door, an enemy that actually shot back - felt like a genuine achievement. Every little thing I figured out was a small victory.

**I was making a game.** And it was actually working.

## The Community Experience

When I finally released my prison escape shooter, I discovered something unexpected: **the game development community**.

### The Feedback Loop
- **Criticism**: "The graphics are rough, the controls feel clunky"
- **Praise**: "Great first attempt! Love the atmosphere"
- **Advice**: "Try working on player feedback - add screen shake when shooting"

Both the harsh critiques and encouraging words were invaluable. They showed me what to improve and, more importantly, that people actually cared about what I was creating.

## What I Learned

1. **No-Code Tools Are Valid**: You don't need to be a programmer to be a game developer
2. **Limitations Breed Creativity**: Having a limited set of tools actually made me more imaginative - when you can't do everything, you get creative with what you can do
3. **Community Matters**: Fellow developers become your greatest teachers
4. **Embrace the Jank**: Your first game won't be perfect, and that's okay
5. **Every Detail Counts**: Even simple additions can dramatically improve the experience

## The Real Victory

My first game wasn't going to win any awards. The graphics were awful and out of place, the gameplay was basic, and the story was cliché. But it was **complete**, **playable**, and **mine**.

More importantly, it opened the door to an incredible community of creators who were all on the same journey - learning, sharing, and building amazing things together.

## Looking Back

That simple corridor shooter taught me more about game development than any tutorial could. Not just the technical aspects, but the joy of creation, the importance of community, and the satisfaction of turning an idea into reality.

**The best part?** The excitement of making that first game never really goes away.
